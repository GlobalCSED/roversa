**Revision 2.2**

- Bearing Holder: Changed screw size for mounting to 2mm hole to thread a M2.5x6 bolt through. This reduces the number of different bolts needed for assembly
- Chassis: Changed screw size to accomodate a 2.5mm bolt for the bearing holder
- Chassis: Aligned LEGO/dowel holes to avoid wheel collision
- Chassis: Adjusted standoffs for PCB mounting - created rounded flex point
- Chassis: Created slot for solder points to rest on shelf for lipo charger module
- Chassis: Adjusted hole diameter for on/off switch to fit latching pushbutton for smaller footprint

**Revision 2.1**

- Move servo mounts to .1"/2.54 distance to accomodate postential JST plugs
- Move USB/Lipo charger module to rear edge of chassis
- Remove LEGO/Mounting holes surround servo motors to increase strength in sides
- Front PCB standoffs do not fit PCB
- Change PCB mounting vias to 4mm to fit on square 3mm plywood for mounting
- Move the on/off switch to sidemount in rear
- Power the servo off the battery 3.3V not directly off of the micro:bit
- Robot is off balance - extend the ball bearing and move servos to front of robot
